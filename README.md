This repo here is my solution for the task given to me.
I used Cypress in IntelliJ Idea IDE, on windows 10 OS

To open it, you will need to install following:
  - Node.Js You can get it here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/ 
  - IDE of your choice, mine is IntelliJ idea: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows (you can use ultimate edition with a free trial)
  - Cypress automation framework: https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress (if you cannot run it through terminal, 
    download it manually, run .exe file and simply drag and drop the project root folder from your IDE to start testing)

Run IntelliJ and start a new project from version control https://prnt.sc/vNGhBgXFNV4S
